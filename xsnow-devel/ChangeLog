version 2.0.11
	pixmaps.c: corrected width and height for snow.
	main.c: simplified create rectangular region
	debian/copyright: corrected
	main.c: remove flakes that fall below bottom of screen, also if
	   no fallensnow on bottom
	main.c: corrected bug which coaused no snow at all with -nomenu
	Lower default snowspeed (SNOWSPEED in xsnow.h)
	update snowflakes in chunks, so that other animations run at
	   desired speed.

version 2.0.10
	prepare for running in wayland by setting environment
	  variable GDK_BACKEND=x11 (main.c)
	fix some typo's in docs.c

version 2.0.9
	some debian adjustments
	fix xfce problems: the workspace of the transparent
	  snow window is not available in xfce
	  some windows have both the _NET_FRAME_EXTENTS and
	  _GTK_FRAME_EXTENTS. Priority is given to the latter.
	Snowflakes that touch fallen snow are not erased any more:
	  erasure caused bad looking effects.
	Removed 'showstats' from config
version 2.0.8
	some more debian stuff
	add support for xfce desktop
version 2.0.7
	added some debian stuff
version 2.05
	Fixed issues when trees are not shown: snow was still
	collecting on trees, snow was not visible after not-shown
	tree. 

version 2.04
	Fixed bug in main.c: check for valid return value of 
	FindWindow() in do_wupdate().

Version 2.03
	Fixed bug in main.c: only set transworkspace if usingtrans.

Version 2.02
	Snowing halted when a workspade before the snow workspace was
	removed. Fixed by checking the workspace of SnowWin in do_wupdate().

Solved in 2.01
	tree-xpm's are mirrored randomly
	flag -treeregion implemented
	fluff on bottom in snow window when nokeepsnowonscreen
	parametrize MAXONTREES
	implement vintage
	in fvwm: after minimize window, no snow is shown on the
	  window when it is restored. 
	Handle window that is visible on all workspaces
	implement no snow when window disappears
	implement nowplow
	Try to snow on trees
	plowing should be partial: only take snow away where Santa was: Won't
	fix
	stars are competing with fallen snow: let snow win: Won't fix
	Create precise region from bitmap vintage tree
	Implement nokeepsnowonwindows etc
	when wind: make generated flakes at bottom cyclic
	Solved strange behaviour with system monitor window
	  and others: gedit, nautilus etc. on gnome desktop
	  no problem on fvwm desktop
	find automatically desired offsets
	  determine size of decoration from a partial screendump ?
	  use xwininfo to point to a gauge window ?
	no rounding of edges of fallen snow at the bottom
	automatically determine tree regions
	create 'fuse': remove nearly all flakes when number is really too high
	for testing purposes: color a region see do_testing()
	read tree.xpm from ~/xsnow/pixmaps/tree.xpm if present
	let Santa plough through fallensnow: do not redraw fallen snow
	   if overlap with Santa
	faster update of fallen snow after move of window
	animation of blown fallen  snow
	extra snow not cyclic
	get rid of flake.x and y, use only rx and ry
	animation of snow fallen from disappeared windows
	gracefully exit when window where is snowing in, disappears
	let trees not overlap
	fallensnow surfaces often too jerky
	round snow at the edges
	animation of do_clean
	let Santa be affected by strong wind
	replace old wind by storm now and then
	offsets for windows & bottom
	wind is changing continuously
	cyclic disappear, appear of flakes
	Solve floating point exception when starting in too small
	  window (oclock) (div by 0 in RandInt)
	move to other workspace of a window: bad behaviour:
	  snow stays on original workspace, window does no
	  receive snow any more: see put correct workspace in fallensnow areas
	  in xsnow.c
	snow on windows: implemented
	ctrl-c sometimes causes: cannot parse output of wmctrl: solved by
	  letting wmctrl return -1 in case of problems

2019-01
	A few minor changes after 1.42:
	changed timing loop
	find Desktop in Gnome and KDE
	can run in user-pointed window (-xwininfo)
	added another kind of tree
	added starts
	added meteorite
	changed algorithm for fallen snow
	nosnowarea's
	and some more ...
