xsnow: let it snow on your desktop

xsnow is derived from Rick Jansen's xsnow-1.42.
It runs in many desktop environments: Gnome, KDE, FVWM, etc.

The file 'dependencies' lists the dependencies. These should be
installed before compiling xsnow.

Compilation and installation:

  tar xf xsnow-<version>.tar.gz
  cd xsnow-<version>
  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install

xsnow will be installed in /usr/local/games.

For users of debian distro's: you can download the appropriate 
.deb file and install with:
  
  sudo apt install ./xsnow_<version>_<arch>.deb

Raspberry pi - Raspian users: choose the .deb with arch='armhf' .

If the above recipes do not work, you can try and run the
script 'simplemake.sh':

  ./simplemake.sh

If problems persist, you can adapt simplemake.sh.

Have fun!
