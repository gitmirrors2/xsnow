This folder contains the graphics for xsnow.

Adding a flake:

Cretae a flake with bitmap:
  bitmap -size <m>x<n>     # example -size 8x7
save as snow<nn>.xbm, where nn is one larger than the highest snow<nn>.xbm, or use
an existing snow number.

example: 
  save as snow41.xbm

Then run in this folder:

  ./snowxbm2xpm.sh  # you need imagemagick

This will re-create all snow??.xpm's from snow??.xbm's

Then, in the root directory (where you see configure.ac), do:

   ./bootstrap    # you will need some autoconf software available

Then:
   ./configure
   make
   make install
