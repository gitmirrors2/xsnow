	Create precise region from bitmap vintage tree
	Implement nokeepsnowonwindows etc
	when wind: make generated flakes at bottom cyclic
	Solved strange behaviour with system monitor window
	  and others: gedit, nautilus etc. on gnome desktop
	  no problem on fvwm desktop
	find automatically desired offsets
	  determine size of decoration from a partial screendump ?
	  use xwininfo to point to a gauge window ?
	no rounding of edges of fallen snow at the bottom

	for testing purposes: color a region see do_testing()

	let Santa plough through fallensnow: do not redraw fallen snow
	   if overlap with Santa
	faster update of fallen snow after move of window

	extra snow not cyclic
	get rid of flake.x and y, use only rx and ry
	animation of snow fallen from disappeared windows
	gracefully exit when window where is snowing in, disappears
	let trees not overlap
	fallensnow surfaces often too jerky
	round snow at the edges
	animation of do_clean
	let Santa be affected by strong wind
	replace old wind by storm now and then
	offsets for windows & bottom
	wind is changing continuously
	cyclic disappear, appear of flakes
	Solve floating point exception when starting in too small
	  window (oclock) (div by 0 in RandInt)
	move to other workspace of a window: bad behaviour:
	  snow stays on original workspace, window does no
	  receive snow any more: see put correct workspace in fallensnow areas
	  in xsnow.c
	snow on windows: implemented
	ctrl-c sometimes causes: cannot parse output of wmctrl: solved by
	  letting wmctrl return -1 in case of problems
